      question: "What is the return on investment (ROI) for a school using VidyaAI?",
      answer: "Schools using VidyaAI save over 32 hours per teacher every month on grading and homework checking workload. This translates directly to reduced administrative costs, decreased teacher burnout and turnover, and elevated academic quality benchmarks that drive enrollment and parent confidence."
    },
    {
      question: "Is VidyaAI replacing teachers?",
      answer: "Not at all. VidyaAI operates as a powerful co-pilot and teaching assistant. We automate repetitive tasks (like scoring baseline questions and generating detailed analytics charts) so teachers can focus entirely on what they do best: lecturing, clarifying deep learning blocks, and providing personalized student guidance."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is AI-based grading?",
      answer: "VidyaAI aligns closely with human examiners by analyzing specific customizable school rubrics and curriculum guidelines. Teachers review and retain total oversight over grades; currently, 98% of AI-generated markings are approved by human instructors without any adjustments."
    },
    {
      question: "Will teachers find it difficult to use?",
      answer: "VidyaAI is designed with administrative simplicity at its core. It requires no elaborate software retraining or workflow adjustments. Teachers upload pictures or PDFs of standard worksheets, and VidyaAI populates grade lists and feedback reports automatically in seconds."
    },
    {
      question: "What types of assessments can be evaluated?",
      answer: "VidyaAI easily evaluates both objective metrics (fill-in-the-blanks, multiple choice lists) and complex subjective exams (math steps, long science answers, humanities essays, diagrams, and formulas) across CBSE, ICSE, and international boards."
